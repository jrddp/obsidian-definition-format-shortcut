# Definition Format Shortcut

Adds a shortcut to quickly format the current line as a definition.

After typing a term, the definition format shortcut will add a customized prefix, format the term in bold, and then add a customized delimiter.

It is recommended to use this plugin alongside the [List Callouts Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-list-callouts) for nicer visuals.
